# Analysis-and-Optimize-Personal-Loan-and-Deposit-Campaigns
Final Project of Applied Data Science_GR5243

The whole project, including analysis, slides and report were made by RMarkdown, which makes them highly reproducable.
The Shiny App was made Rstudio, which is a user-friendly reporting enginee.

Because of the limited pages of the report, almost all the visualization parts are in the slides. 
Please refer to the slides and code for slides for the visualization.

Also, the slides contain all the information of important parts of this project, 
please refer to slides if you think the report is too wordy (actually, it is).

Note: Since I use adaboost, which is very slow to generate


Summary of all the works:

1. Cleaned data and built interactive application by R shiny. Found this campaign is lack of selecting clients and channels.

2. Built logistic regression, random forest and AdaBoost models to target clients, select channels and high yield clients. 
The efficiency increases 27 times, the accuracy is 99% for channels, the increment of loan for high yield clients is 30%.

3. Built logistic regression and SVM models to increase response rate. All the AUC values for models are higher than 0.85.
